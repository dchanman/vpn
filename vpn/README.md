# Main
The `main` module is meant to be a base class for our future client/server modules which will each implement a different side of a key-sharing protocol. This module encapsulates the basic socket methods.

## Testing

On one terminal, run:
```
$ ./main.py
```

Set up according to your desires, run a second window to have a Server and Client to talk to yourself!
